## Introduction
The multiplayer UNO game is an online version of the popular card game UNO. It allows multiple players to join a virtual game room and play UNO together in real-time. The game utilizes React for the front-end user interface, Socket.IO for real-time communication between the server and clients, and Express and Node.js for the back-end server implementation.

## Usage
To run the multiplayer UNO game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Start the server:
   ```shell
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:YOUR_PORT_NUMBER`, where `YOUR_PORT_NUMBER` is the port number you configured in the `.env` file.

3. Create a new game room or join an existing one.

4. Share the game room URL with your friends and wait for them to join.

5. Play UNO with your friends! The game will provide instructions and handle the game logic automatically.

## Technologies
The multiplayer UNO game is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Socket.IO: A real-time event-based communication library for web applications.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
